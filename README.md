# Face Recognition Based Smart Attendance System Build By Using Python & Machine Learning
The Face Recognition-Based Smart Attendance System is an innovative application of Python and Machine Learning that streamlines the traditional attendance tracking process. By leveraging facial recognition technology, this system offers a seamless and efficient way to record attendance in various settings, such as classrooms, workplaces, and events.
Here I have used KNN (K Neighrest Neighbour) Algorithm to build a Real-time Facial Recognition System.
